description: 'She entered ferociously, a week early in a whirlwind of pain and joy and after the lowest, scariest time in my life. A ray of sunshine in the darkest place and a living paradox showing the miracles that only can come from a mysterious higher power. I turned to God in those weeks before she was born and connected in a new way, and looking back to it, although the pain body still shows itself here and there- I have become a new stronger more confident parent and person. I hadn’t planned anything about her, and everything about her was peaceful. She brought a peace with her that I have never experienced in my life. Her beauty and calm spirit played a steady tune each day singing; “you can do it, keep going, you got this” Her perfection was an extension of the intimacy I had just experienced with God and I will never forget how the choas of the pregnancy was worth the connection that followed. I love you sweet Eden, you teach me how to persevere, how to love, how to access peace. I love you forever and I will always be thankful for you, and whoever you become.'

She entered ferociously, a week early in a whirlwind of pain and joy and after the lowest, scariest time in my life. A ray of sunshine in the darkest place and a living paradox showing the miracles that only can come from a mysterious higher power. I turned to God in those weeks before she was born and connected in a new way, and looking back to it, although the pain body still shows itself here and there- I have become a new stronger more confident parent and person. I hadn't planned anything about her, and everything about her was peaceful. She brought a peace with her that I have never experienced in my life. Her beauty and calm spirit played a steady tune each day singing; "you can do it, keep going, you got this" Her perfection was an extension of the intimacy I had just experienced with God and I will never forget how the choas of the pregnancy was worth the connection that followed.
